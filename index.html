                    <!--- short biography -->
                    Hello! My name is Jonathon Stillson, but I typically go by Jon. 
                    I'm originally from Grand Haven Michigan, but I've moved around 
                    all my life and lived in MI, MN, AK, NC, CA, NY, VA, FL, and MA.

                    <!--- education history -->
                    After high school early graduation in 2006, I joined the USCG and went to
                    a year long "A School" to become an Electronics Technician. In 2017 
                    I used TA through the USCG and credits given for military training 
                    programs to obtain an AAS in Electronics Engineering Technology. In 
                    2022 I completed an AS in Computer Science at Tidewater Community College.
                    In 2022/2023 I completed some courses in the BS Computer Science program at 
                    Old Dominion University.

                    <!--- job experience overview -->
                    I was an Electronics Technician in the USCG for 12 years. I joined in 
                    2006 at the age of 17. Upon my separation in 2018 I was a First Class

                    electronic communications and navigation equipment.

                    My goals are to eventually complete my BS in CS following finishing CF 
                    and obtaining a job in the field. I intend on moving out of Virginia at 
                    some point hopefully within the next 5 years.
